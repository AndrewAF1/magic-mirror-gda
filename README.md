# magic-mirror-gda

`magic-mirror-gda` was written for Gonzaga College High School's production of Beauty and the Beast in March 2018. Dispite being functional, it never made it into the final show. OSC commands sent from QLab are recieved by this script and used to control a RGB strip connected to the GPIO pins of a Raspberry Pi.
